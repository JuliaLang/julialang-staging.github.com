# GSoC Project Ideas Page

This page lists a bunch of project ideas, meant to serve as starting points as you develop your own plan. You're free to modify them to your tastes, or propose something totally different in an area you're interested in.

Check out the [application guidelines](guidelines/) once you have a project in mind.

**Table of Contents**

We have our project ideas organised roughly into the skillsets required:

* [Turing projects](projects/turing.html) for probabilistic modelling and probabilistic programming.
* [Flux projects](https://fluxml.ai/gsoc.html) for machine learning.
* [Compiler](projects/compiler.html) – work on the Julia compiler's internals to make things better for everyone.
* [Web Platform](projects/wasm.html) - work on the Julia wasm backend or other aspects of julia in the browser.
* [HPC](projects/hpc.html) – write code that runs on lots of machines, goes really fast, processes lots of data, or all three.
* [Numerics](projects/numerics.html) – Challenges for the hard–core number-cruncher, including linear algebra routines and basic mathematical functions.
* [Science](projects/science.html) - provide Julia with the ability for scientific research in various fields.
* [Differential Equations](projects/diffeq.html) - Numerical methods for high-performance solving of differential equation models
* [Tooling](projects/tooling.html) – The projects that make the people that make Julia go, go. Help us make a really amazing IDE!
* [Images](projects/images.html) – extend Julia's suite of tools for visualization and analysis of images.
* [Audio and DSP](projects/audiodsp.html) – improve Julia's analysis, processing, and synthesis packages for audio and more general digital signal processing.
* [General](projects/general.html) – jack-of-all-trades projects that don't require special skills.
* [Graphics](projects/graphics.html) - projects ranging from low level OpenGL rendering to high level plotting
* [Tabular Data](projects/tables.html)
