<h2>Research</h2>
<p>
<p>Research on Julia is carried out at the <a href="https://julia.mit.edu">Julia Lab at MIT</a> and at many universities worldwide. If you use Julia in your research, we request citing the following paper:</p>

<p>
{% assign beks17 = site.publications | where:"path","_publications/BEKS17.md" | first %}
<div>{% include citation.html pub=beks17 %}</div>
</p>

<p>
For publications related to different aspects of the Julia project, see the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/CITATION.bib">CITATION.bib</a> file on the Julia repository. Similarly, Julia packages may choose to include a CITATION.bib file in their repos. This provides a standardized way for researchers to find and use citation information for Julia and Julia packages.
</p>

<h2>Prizes and Awards</h2>

<h2>Sponsors</h2>
<p>
We thank our sponsors for making Julia possible:
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu">Lincoln Laboratory</a>: <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~kepner/">Dr. Jeremy Kepner</a> is the founding sponsor of the Julia project.
<li> <a href="https://www.moore.org/article-detail?newsUrlName=bringing-julia-from-beta-to-1.0-to-support-data-intensive-scientific-computing">Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</a>
<li> <a href="https://sloan.org/grant-detail/7999">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a>
<li> Intel
<li> Research grants from various agencies have led to Julia contributions: <a href="https://nsf.gov">NSF</a>, <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/">DARPA</a>, <a href="https://www.nih.gov/">NIH</a>, <a href="https://nasa.gov">NASA</a>, and <a href="https://www.faa.gov/">FAA</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Publications</h2>
<p>
Here's a list of publications about the Julia language, its standard
library, Julia packages, and technical computing applications. It
is by no means complete, and is based on submissions by
authors. A broader list of papers is available on <a href =
"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=12373977815425691465&as_sdt=40000005&sciodt=0,22&hl=en">Google
Scholar</a>.
</p>

In order to make Julia packages and projects easy to cite, the
community has settled on a standard location and format for
bibliographic information.  Please add a CITATION.bib file (BibTeX
format) in the top-level directory of your package or repo. The key
for the bib entry should be &lt;PackageName.jl&gt;-&lt;year&gt;-&lt;letter&gt; (Use a
letter if you have multiple citations in same year). For example, see
the
<a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/CITATION.bib">CITATION.bib</a>
file in the Julia repo.

We welcome additions to this list in the form of
<a href = "https://github.com/JuliaLang/www.julialang.org/tree/master/_publications#readme">pull requests</a>.
