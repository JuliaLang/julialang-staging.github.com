# Projects

This page lists a bunch of project ideas, meant to serve as starting points as you develop your own plan. You're free to modify them to your tastes, or propose something totally different in an area you're interested in.

We have our project ideas organized roughly into the skill sets required:

@@tight-list
* [Compiler](/jsoc/gsoc/compiler/) – work on the Julia compiler's internals to make things better for everyone.
* [DeepChem.jl](/jsoc/gsoc/deepchem/) – Machine learning for atomic systems in Julia
* [DFTK.jl](/jsoc/gsoc/dftk/) – Density-functional theory in Julia
* [Differential Equations](/jsoc/gsoc/diffeq/) - Numerical methods for high-performance solving of differential equation models.
* [Documentation tooling](/jsoc/gsoc/documenter/) - Tooling related to documentation generation, docstrings etc.
* [Flux.jl](/jsoc/gsoc/flux/) - A flexible deep learning library.
* [GeoStats.jl](/jsoc/gsoc/GeoStats/) - An extensible framework for high-performance geostatistics in Julia.
* [High Performance and Parallel Computing](/jsoc/gsoc/hpc/) – write code that runs on lots of machines, goes really fast, processes lots of data, or all three.
* [Images](/jsoc/gsoc/images/) – extend Julia's suite of tools for visualization and analysis of images.
* [Javis](/jsoc/gsoc/javis/) - **J**ulia **a**nimations and **vis**ualizations for teaching, communication, and beyond!
* [JuliaDynamics](/jsoc/gsoc/juliadynamics/) - Dynamical systems, complex systems and nonlinear dynamics in Julia
* [MLJ.jl](/jsoc/gsoc/MLJ/) – a Machine Learning Toolbox for Julia.
* [Numerics](/jsoc/gsoc/numerics/) – Challenges for the hard–core number-cruncher, including linear algebra routines and basic mathematical functions.
* [Pluto](/jsoc/gsoc/pluto/) - Pluto notebooks and tools for teaching
* [Pythia](/jsoc/gsoc/pythia/) - scalable time series for Julia.
* [SciML](/jsoc/gsoc/sciml/) - Scientific Machine Learning
* [Signal processing](/jsoc/gsoc/kalmanbucy/) - Continuous time Signal Processing
* [Symbolic computation](/jsoc/gsoc/symbolics/) - User friendly symbolic programming
* [Tabular Data](/jsoc/gsoc/tables/) - Working with data
