# Julia Packages

The Julia ecosystem contains over 3000 packages which means finding the right package can be a challenge. Fortunately, there are services that can help navigate the ecosystem, including:

* [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com) — a service which includes search of all registered open source package documentation, code search, and navigation by tags/keywords.
* [JuliaPackages](https://juliapackages.com) — see what packages are popular and/or trending, navigate by package categories.
* [Julia.jl](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl) — a manually curated taxonomy of Julia packages (category information for JuliaPackages is derived from this as well).
