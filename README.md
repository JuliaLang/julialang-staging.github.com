This is an attempt at copying [https://julialang.org]() using Franklin.jl.

## How to maintain this

Clone the repository, `cd` to it, and, in Julia, assuming you have Franklin do
`using Franklin; serve()` then go to `localhost:8000` on your browser and edit
away.

If you want to fix the css go to `_css/`, if you want to fix the infrastructure (e.g. add a button somewhere), go to  `_layout/`, if you want to do  anything and somehow it doesn't seem straightforward, ping @tlienart.
